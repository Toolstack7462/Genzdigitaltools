# Gen Z Digital Store — PRD

## Original Problem Statement
Repo: https://github.com/Toolstack7462/Genzdigitaltools (Node/Express + React + Chrome MV3 + MySQL)

Main issue: Client dashboard shows assigned tools, but Access button says
expired / 403 / "could not prepare secure access". Goal — make Access reliable
using a SharePass-style extension-controlled flow (extension fetches latest
session, injects cookies, opens tool). The frontend must never receive the
session bundle.

### Required Flow
Client clicks Access → frontend sends toolId to extension → extension asks
backend for latest allowed session → backend uses SAME access logic as the
client dashboard → backend returns tool URL + session bundle ONLY to extension
→ frontend NEVER receives it → extension clears target cookies/storage →
extension injects session → extension opens/reloads tool in separate tab.

### Bugs Addressed
- no tool_access_expired if dashboard still shows the tool
- no old expired duplicate assignment overriding new active assignment
- always pick the latest active assignment for (clientId, toolId)
- date-only endDate must be valid until 23:59:59
- admin assignment updates take effect immediately
- extension must not use stale cached assignment
- no reused consumed open-intent token
- normalize toolId as string everywhere
- support `openIntentToken || intentToken`
- retry only token errors, not business errors

### Other Requested Changes
- Public CTA "Get Started" must open client signup, not Contact Us.
- Create `/client/signup` and/or `/client/register`.
- Admin/Client "View Website" opens https://genzdigitalstore.com in new tab.
- Tool Access opens/reuses a separate tab, never replaces the dashboard tab.
- Internal links stay in same tab. Logout redirects same tab.
- UI quick polish only: compact dashboard cards, larger aligned logo.
- Safe debug logs (clientId, toolId, assignmentId, endDate, serverTime,
  hasSessionBundle, cookieSetCount, failedCount, stage, reason).

## Implemented (Feb 2026 fork session)

### P0.5 — Extension auto-connect resilience (Feb 2026)
**Broken:** Dashboard's "Auto connecting…" gave up silently after 8 × 1.5s = 12s
with no visible reason, no retry button. Popup showed "Disconnected" even when
the dashboard tab was open — no way to trigger reconnect from the popup. Access
button could not open tools because the underlying extension session was never
established.

**Fixed:**
- `useExtension.js`: exponential backoff retry (1.5s → cap 30s) that runs as
  long as the dashboard tab is open. Auto-escalates to `forceReauth:true` after
  3 consecutive failures. Exposes `reason`, `attemptCount`, `lastError`, and
  a `reconnect()` callback. Listens for `GENZ_FORCE_RECONNECT` push.
- `ClientDashboardEnhanced.js`: after the 1st failure the banner shows the
  reason + a "Retry connection" button wired to `reconnect()`.
- `popup.html` / `popup.js`: added **Reconnect Now** button in the disconnected
  section that focuses the dashboard tab and sends `GENZ_FORCE_RECONNECT` (or
  opens the dashboard if none).
- `bridge.js`: `GENZ_FORCE_RECONNECT` added to SAFE_PUSH_TYPES so the SW can
  route it into the dashboard page.
- `background.js`: `GENZ_CONNECT_EXTENSION` clears stale extension storage on
  401/403/invalid-token rejections and returns status+code so the UI displays
  precise reasons.
- Manifest bumped 3.8.4 → 3.8.5; extension zip rebuilt.

### P0 — Shared `getClientAccessibleTool` helper
- **New: `backend/utils/getClientAccessibleTool.js`** — single source of truth:
  - `getClientAccessibleTool(clientId, toolId)` → `{ ok, tool, assignment, candidates, code }`
  - `listClientAccessibleTools(clientId)` → `[{ tool, assignment }, ...]`
- Routes now consult ONE helper:
  - `routes/client/tools.js` — `GET /` (list), `GET /:toolId` (detail), `POST /:toolId/open-intent`
  - `routes/extension/index.js` — `GET /tools/:toolId/credentials`, `POST /verify-intent`
- Behaviour preserved from prior fixes: inclusive end-of-day expiry via
  `ToolAssignment.effectiveEndBoundary`, latest assignment wins, string-
  normalised toolId, exact access codes (`assignment_not_found`,
  `assignment_expired`, `session_bundle_missing`, `tool_domain_invalid`),
  one-time open-intent only consumed after assignment validates.
- Extension `background.js` clears target cookies, re-fetches credentials
  per click, injects pre-navigation, opens in a separate tab, never persists
  decrypted credentials in cache (only safe metadata).
- `useExtension.openTool` enforces BUSINESS_RESULT_STAGES → no retry;
  token errors trigger ONE retry with FRESH activation + FRESH intent token.

### P1 — Signup CTA
- Added routes: `/client/signup`, `/client/register` (alias `Join.js`).
- `PublicNavbar` Get Started CTA (desktop + mobile) → `/client/signup`.

### P2 — Navigation / UI
- Existing target="_blank" "View Website" verified (Admin + Client layouts).
- Tool Access opens via `chrome.tabs.create()` → separate tab (verified).
- Public navbar logo enlarged (`size="md"` → `size="lg"`).

### Verification
- `node --check` ✅ on `getClientAccessibleTool.js`, `routes/client/tools.js`, `routes/extension/index.js`
- `yarn install --legacy-peer-deps` ✅
- `yarn build` ✅ (CI=false; pre-existing eslint warnings unchanged)
- Commit `565204a` staged locally — push requires user to use **Save to GitHub**.

## Backlog
- E2E manual validation in a real Chrome browser with the unpacked extension.
- Jest/supertest unit tests for `getClientAccessibleTool` covering:
  - duplicate active+expired rows → latest valid wins
  - date-only endDate same day → valid through 23:59:59
  - `assignment_not_found` vs `assignment_expired` distinction

### Client Dashboard — Premium Compact UI (Feb 2026)
**Goal:** Make `/client/dashboard` look compact, premium, "world-class SaaS"
without breaking any logic.

**Done:**
- Slim welcome/membership banner: navy→teal gradient + radial glow accents,
  one-row layout (greeting + tools badge + Plan + Website + Profile), inline date.
- Stat cards: compact glass cards (px-3.5 py-3) with left color rail, soft
  inset, color-tinted icon container, fixed contrast (forced `#071B33` / `#5B6B7C`
  inline so `.app-main .text-genz-navy { color:#eaf2fb !important }` doesn't
  wash them out on the dark canvas), tabular-nums big number, bold label,
  muted sub-text. Hover: -translate-y-0.5 + color glow shadow.
- Expiry warning: slim dark amber glass strip (was light amber card).
- Chrome Extension banner: slim dark glass strip with cyan glow + "Install"
  pill button (was full-height light card).
- Section headings (Featured Tools, All Your Tools) switched to `text-white`
  + cyan accent count badge for readability on navy canvas.
- Search input + category filter pills: dark glass with white text and
  cyan-gradient active pill (was white inputs).
- Reduced vertical spacing throughout (`space-y-3`, gap-3, smaller paddings)
  so more content appears above the fold.

**Files touched:**
- `frontend/src/pages/client/ClientDashboardEnhanced.js` — entire dashboard
  surface restyled; logic, routes, data fetching, openTool flow untouched.

**Verification:** Visual screenshot with mocked tools/expiring data on
`/client/dashboard` confirmed: stat-card text now crisp, banners slim,
sections compact, theme cohesive with dark navy app canvas.


- Further UI compaction of admin members/assignments tables (cosmetic).

## Access Codes (single vocabulary across the codebase)
- `assignment_not_found` — no assignment row exists for (clientId, toolId)
- `assignment_expired`   — row(s) exist but all are expired/inactive/not-started
- `session_bundle_missing` — assignment valid but admin hasn't saved usable session
- `tool_domain_invalid`  — tool has no targetUrl/domain
- `extension_token_invalid` — extension token bad/missing/expired
- `intent_invalid`       — open-intent token bad/expired/consumed
- `device_blocked`       — device-binding mismatch in hard mode
